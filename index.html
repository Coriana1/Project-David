    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p class="one">Hey! My name is David Dickens, I'm currently located in Columbus Ohio. I am a full time student at Code Fellows in their Full-stack Javascript developer course. I have a background mainly focused in restaurants and also the Army. While in the Army I had 2 jobs, first being an Infantryman then changing to Human Intelligence. Since I got out I've been looking for a direction to go in that plays towards my strengths which lead to the tech field. The constant puzzles and problem solving involved keeps me interested always wanting to learn more. My goal is to complete the training im in then land a job as a Software Developer.</p>
